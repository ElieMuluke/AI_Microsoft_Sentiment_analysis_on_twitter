# AI_Microsoft_Sentiment_analysis_on_twitter

A sentiment analysis based on twitter dataset to analyze sentiment toward Microsoft

## Problem Statement

The problem being addressed is sentiment analysis of tweets about a particular company. The goal is to build models that can predict the sentiment of a tweet (positive, negative, or neutral) based on the tweet's text.

## Solution

The solution involves reading a CSV file of labeled tweets, filtering tweets related to a particular company, splitting the data into training and testing sets, and building three different machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression) using pipelines.
The models are trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set using classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy scores. Finally, the trained models can be used to predict the sentiment of new tweets about the same company.
